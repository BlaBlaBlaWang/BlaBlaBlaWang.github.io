My blog repo.

I would wirte some simple essays on this website to... practice typing.

Since this site is immature, any suggestions or jokes are welcome to the "Issues" on this repo. Also, the comments function has become available, using `utterances bot`, your comment under any of the posts would become an issue on this repo so that I would reply in time.

If you ask me why not make this site more brilliant, my answer is: Next year for sure~
